<H1> DAILY DOG DIARY! </H1>
<div class="CIRCLE"></div>
<H2>
  Today, when I went to the park, I saw this teeny tiny Italian Greyhound that was literally as thin as a twig and as small as a really small rock. I asked his owner what his name was and he ignored me, probably because I was like frothing at the mouth from excited I probably scared him away. Anyways, I'd like to think his name is Cheese and his owners name is Owen (very creative I know). The dog really looked like a cheese, and his owner looked like a pretentious hipster so I doubt Im too far off honestly. Anyways, here are some facts about Italian Greyhounds.

  The Italian Greyhound dog breed was a favorite companion of noblewomen in the Middle Ages, especially in Italy. But this small hound was more than a lapdog, having the speed, endurance, and determination to hunt small game. These days, theyâ€™re a family dog whose beauty and athleticism is admired in the show ring and in obedience, agility, and rally competitions.
