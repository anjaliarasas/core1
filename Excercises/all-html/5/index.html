<h2> <bdo dir="rtl"> I'm trapped in an alternate universe where everything is backwards </bdo> </h2>
<p><bdo dir="rtl">Dear Diary, it has been 3 weeks since I fell into that dirty old well and am now in an alternate universe where everything is backwards. It takes me twenty minutes to tie my shoes every morning. I'M SO ANGRY!! Even typing this is a struggle because I have to write each word BACKWARDS! I'd like to see you try to do that diary, its so hard. Also I have the worst headache ever because I have to think backwards too. Get me out of this hellhole. </bdo></p>
